- The voter turnout for each county
- The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
- The county with the highest turnout

# Election-Audit Results: 
The image below provides a snapshot of the following information: How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
  - The total votes in this congressional election
  - A breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct
  - The county that had the largest number of votes
  - A breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
  - The candidate that won the election, their vote count, and percentage of the total votes

  ## Challenge Summary
This script has provided a detailed breakdown of the election results and is both reusable and expandable for other elections as well. If given the opportunity we can adapt the script to include a more detailed breakdown that could include the following information for example:
-	Votes by precinct for each candidate
-	Percent votes by precinct for each candidate
-	 A breakdown of how many votes a candidate trailed the winner in each county
With this additional information, candidates can learn where their campaigning is strongest and where there is a need for more campaigning in the future.
